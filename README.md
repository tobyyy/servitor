- Look at the discord.js example project and setup discord stuff accordingly
- Create your config.json based on the config.json.template
- embrace the madness of javascript world
- be glad for typescript


- hustle yourself nodejs 16 with npm
- run ```npm install```
  - compile typescript and run bot with ```npm start```
  - compile typescript and deploy slash commands with ```npm run deploy-commands```
  - compile typescript with ```npm run tsc```
  - compile typescript in watch mode for interactive compiler screaming with ```npm run watch```


- this project is set up in strict mode, have fun with very annoying null safety :P
